<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank" title="Javascript specification">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is <strong>a high-level, interpreted programming language</strong> that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. <br><br><img src="coding_javascript.jpg" width="75%"></p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
